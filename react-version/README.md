# React Version of Portfolio Site

This is a standalone React implementation of Warren Martin's video portfolio site. The implementation includes:

## Features

- React-based implementation using React 18
- In-browser JSX transpilation (for simplicity and portability)
- Particles.js background identical to main site
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Dynamic navigation between video categories
- Visual effects matching the main site (shimmer effect, hover animations, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. No build process required - this is a self-contained React application

## Implementation Notes

- Uses CDN-hosted React, ReactDOM, and Babel for simplicity
- Video data is structured as JavaScript objects for easy management
- Navigation is dynamic and state-managed
- All styles are contained directly in the HTML file

## Future Enhancements

This could be expanded to a full React application using:
- Create React App or Next.js
- Proper component file structure
- External CSS/SCSS files
- API integration for dynamic content
